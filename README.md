:root {
    --primary: #4361ee;      /* Primary brand color */
    --secondary: #3f37c9;    /* Secondary accents */
    --accent: #4895ef;       /* Accent highlights */
    --success: #4cc9f0;      /* Success indicators */
    --warning: #f72585;      /* Warning/alerts */
    --dark: #2b2d42;         /* Dark elements */
    --light: #f8f9fa;        /* Light backgrounds */
    /* ... and more */
}
```

### Layout Customization

The dashboard uses CSS Grid with defined template areas:
- **Header**: Top navigation with search, theme toggle, and user info
- **Sidebar**: Left navigation menu
- **Content**: Main dashboard area with sub-grids for various sections
